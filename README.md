# Legal Contract Q&A Bot

This repository contains the code and data for the Legal Contract Q&A Bot, a project aimed at creating an intelligent system that can understand, analyze, and respond to questions about legal contracts. Developed as part of an ongoing effort to innovate legal technology, this project focuses on enhancing contract comprehension through a powerful AI-driven Q&A platform. The project’s mission is to create, evaluate, and enhance a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system tailored for legal contract Q&A, enabling users to engage interactively with legal documents and receive accurate answers to their queries.

## Business Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a state-of-the-art AI assistant that transforms how legal contracts are reviewed and interpreted. By leveraging advanced language models, retrieval systems, and machine learning techniques, our goal is to build an intelligent Q&A bot that not only answers questions about contracts with precision but also assists in contract analysis, review, and advisory tasks. The ultimate vision is to establish an AI that functions as a virtual legal advisor, capable of providing expert-level insights instantly.

## Q&A Bot Overview

The Legal Contract Q&A Bot is designed using an advanced architecture that combines the strengths of large language models (LLMs) with dynamic retrieval mechanisms. This hybrid approach ensures that the bot can generate highly accurate and contextually relevant responses by accessing and integrating external data sources into its answers. The bot can handle various contract types and complex legal terminology, making it a versatile tool for legal professionals and businesses alike.

## Project Structure

The development process is structured into several key phases:

-	Task 1: Research current state-of-the-art approaches in contract analysis and legal AI.
-	Task 2: Implement a basic Q&A pipeline that utilizes retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for answering contract-related queries.
-	Task 3: Build and fine-tune a specialized evaluation framework to assess the bot’s performance on legal-specific tasks.
-	Task 4: Explore optimization techniques to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the Q&A responses.
-	Task 5: Deploy enhancements to the pipeline, focusing on context understanding and response precision.
-	Task 6: Interpret the bot’s outputs and compile detailed performance reports to guide further improvements.

 ## Data

The data used in this project includes:

- A curated set of legal contracts (ranging from simple agreements to complex documents) accompanied by a series of test questions and validated answers to evaluate bot performance.
- Additional data sources from legal databases and publicly available contract repositories to enhance the bot’s retrieval capabilities.

 
## Dependencies

The project depends on the following tools and libraries:

- LangChain: A leading framework for building applications with language models.
- Hugging Face Transformers: Provides access to a wide range of pre-trained language models suitable for legal text processing.
- Custom Retrieval Modules: Tailored for extracting relevant information from legal documents in real-time.
